\part*{The Nearest Neighbor Algorithm}

\section*{Algorithm Description}
The nearest neighbour algorithm is a greedy algorithm that solves the traveling salesman problem by continually choosing the nearest unvisited city on his tour. True to its nature the algorithm works quickly and effectively. Given a randomly distributed number of cities this algorithm will yield a tour that is on average 25\% longer than the shortest possible path.[1]

However, there exist many specially arranged city distributions which make the NN algorithm give the worst route.[18] This is true for both asymmetric and symmetric TSPs.[19] Rosenkrantz et al.[20] showed that the NN algorithm has the approximation factor $\Theta (\log |V|)$ for instances satisfying the triangle inequality. 
\\[.25cm]
A variation of NN algorithm, called Nearest Fragment (NF) operator, which connects a group (fragment) of nearest unvisited cities, can find shorter route with successive iterations.[21] The NF operator can also be applied on an initial solution obtained by NN algorithm for further improvement in an elitist model, where only better solutions are accepted.
